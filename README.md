Digital Entity Resurrection using Artificial Machine Learned Intelligence (AMLI)

We envision a fully operable computer software function capable of taking arguments from end-users and responding holographically in real-time using an accurate approximation of our subject's inner voices from their formative years until their deaths 'ex vivo'.

Tweaks of improvement will no doubt come as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) behind the model-construct learns exponentially via Machine Learning (ML) the intricacies and neural network behind the vast body of work performed by the subject entity during their lives 'en vivo'.

Learn the story behind 'The Ex-Vivo Lazarus Project' and help us meet our campaign goal via @indiegogo C=> [ExVivoSpace](https://igg.me/at/ExVivoSpace) #GotAMLI? #TryExVivo #LazarusProject

In addition, funding for equipment to faciliate the Machine Learning of our algorithms is alternatively offered thru @indiegogo C=> [McKennAI](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-digital-resurrection-of-terence-mckenna)

Invitations for experienced coding entities well-schooled in the art of Artificial Machine Learned Intelligence, or AMLI have been sent from the [Machine Elves](https://github.com/orgs/MMINAIL/teams/machine-elves ) team portal to selected individuals.

Please respond with an acceptance if you feel your expertise in the growing field of AMLI can be of assistance to our project.

Thank you,

The Management
